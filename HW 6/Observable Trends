The three trends I noticed were:
    
    1)The temperature forms a gradient with reference to Lat confirming that
    the closer you get to Lat 0 (equator) the higher the temperature is.
    
    2)Wind speeds are higher +40/-40 of the equator
    
    3)Most cities, regardless of latitude have relatively low wind speeds
